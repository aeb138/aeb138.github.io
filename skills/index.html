<p> Allison Brekosky is a Pittsburgh native with an incredible talent: that girl can sing. With over thirteen years of trained experience and working with music professionals, Allison is ready to let her voice be heard, and brings you this website showcasing some of her greatest musical accomplishments. Since the beginning of her singing career, Allison has gone through several hardships, including a lifetime-long vocal condition, for which she has had two surgeries. But she has persisted through it all, and has continued to share her voice through YouTube. Now she is becoming more serious about her craft and is looking to go from the Internet screen - to something even bigger! 
<br> </br>
This will all culminate with her performance on <i> Music Talks </i>, her first major gig on Armstrong Television in Pittsburgh! This is all happening in May 2019 so stay tuned and keep updated here until then!
