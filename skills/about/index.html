      <li> <b> PERSONAL LIFE </b> </li>  
allison elizabeth brekosky was born october 23rd, 1998 in pittsburgh, pennsylvania. always living within pittsburgh's tri-state area has been a blessing for the singer, as the city atmosphere has attracted some big names, allowing allison to work with professionals from all over the country. she grew up with both parents, <a href= "http://instagram.com/dbrekosky"> dave </a> and <a href = "http://instagram.com/jillbrekosky"> jill </a> brekosky, and one older brother, <a href = "http://instagram.com/jacobbrekosky"> jacob brekosky </a>. her biggest musical inspirations are her grandmothers; her paternal grandmother, the late florence brekosky, who gifted her her first piano at a very young age, and her maternal grandmother, <a href=http://instagram.com/gigapatv"> patricia veseleny </a> who is the singer of the family.
allison is currently a junior at the university of pittsburgh in oakland, pa., where she studies communication and music. in communication she has landed internships with the walt disney company, and is currently interviewing for several intern positions at some of pittsburgh's largest tv stations. besides singing, the 20-year-old also has hobbies in writing, video editing, and working at panera.     
   <li> <b> EARLY BEGINNINGS (1998-2012) </b> </li>
<p> at eighteen months old, allison underwent a small surgery, unrelated to her voice. yet, at this age, she began talking, and her voice had a very raspy quality to it. while under anesthesia, it was discovered that allison had vocal nodules. due to the placement of the nodules, she never got them removed, however went through three procedures and several years of voice therapy to keep from damaging her voice any further.
<p> allison began singing when she began talking. however, it was not until the age of 12 that she seriously became involved with music. her practice started at accelerando music conservatory in the south hills of pittsburgh. here, she worked under the direction of christina chirumbolo and david dabbon, both of whom have earned names for themselves in new york city. she has also worked alongside daya, a pittsburgh-native and american popstar. this experience at accelerando lasted from 2010-2014, and gained allison some of the best contacts in music she has ever had. outside of accelerando, allison has also been a student at both lori allen dance center (2006-2011) and david's music house (2012-2015).
   <li> <b> HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE (2012-PRESENT) </b> </li> 
<p> in 2012, allison was a freshman at canon-mcmillan high school. after not being involved in musical activities in school for nearly five years, she found herself in the high school's music wing for the first time her sophomore year. over the next three years, allison would find herself being a part of canon mcmillan's choir and drama club, and eventually became more and more skilled, later joining the chamber choir, bella voce and international thespian society. as previously mentioned, she also has a skill and hobby in video editing, and therefore created videos online for these groups, seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/uc5yxqunewieni2hqhby75uw/videos"> here. </a> in 2016, allison graduated canon-mcmillan high school, with honors in tri-m music society, among others.
<p> in august 2016, allison started at the university of pittsburgh at greensburg, studying communication and music. she was involved in several extracurriculars here as well, the most important of which being pitt-greensburg chorale. allison quickly found herself in the position of assistant stage manager, and then president of the group, all within her first semester of college. other related extracurriculars include chamber singers, performing arts society, and distinct voices a cappella, for which she was a founding member. at pitt-greensburg, she met chelsea rittenhour, the host of the brand new show <i> music talks. </i>
<p> in january 2019, allison transferred to pitt's main campus in oakland, pa. now as a junior, she continued on her path of studying communication and music. and, like in greensburg, she joined a music-based extracurricular: pitt pendulums, of which she is a first-year member.
   <li> <b> THE FUTURE </b> </li>
