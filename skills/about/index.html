      <li> <b> Personal Life </b> </li>  
<p> Allison Elizabeth Brekosky was born October 23rd, 1998 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Always living within Pittsburgh's tri-state area has been a blessing for the singer, as the city atmosphere has attracted some big names, allowing Allison to work with professionals from all over the country. She grew up with both parents, <a href= "http://instagram.com/dbrekosky"> Dave </a> and <a href = "http://instagram.com/jillbrekosky"> Jill </a> Brekosky, and one older brother, <a href = "http://instagram.com/jacobbrekosky"> Jacob Brekosky </a>. Her biggest musical inspirations are her grandmothers; her paternal grandmother, the late Florence Brekosky, who gifted her her first piano at a very young age, and her maternal grandmother, <a href=http://instagram.com/gigapatv"> Patricia Veseleny </a> who is the singer of the family.
   <li> <b> Early Beginnings (1998-2012) </b> </li>
<p> At eighteen months old, Allison underwent a small surgery, unrelated to her voice. Yet, at this age, she began talking, and her voice had a very raspy quality to it. While under anesthesia, it was discovered that Allison had vocal nodules. Due to the placement of the nodules, she never got them removed, however went through three procedures and several years of voice therapy to keep from damaging her voice any more.
<p> Allison began singing when she began talking. However, it was not until the age of 12 that she seriously became involved with music. Her practice started at Accelerando Music Conservatory in the South Hills of Pittsburgh. Here, she worked under the direction of Christina Chirumbolo and David Dabbon, both of whom have earned names for themselves in New York City. She has also worked alongside Daya, a Pittsburgh-native and American popstar. This experience at Accelerando lasted from 2010-2014, and gained Allison some of the best contacts in music she has ever had. Outside of Accelerando, Allison has also been a student at both Lori Allen Dance Center (2006-2011) and David's Music House (2012-2015).
