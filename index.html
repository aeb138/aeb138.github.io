    <h4> my pittsburgh dataset project. </h4>

    <p> food. it brings people together. and college kids, especially those at the university of pittsburgh are no exception to this rule. and when you're in college, you're always on the move. therefore, fast food is normally the way to go.
      <p> so when it came time to decide upon the subject matter for this assignment, i chose to hone in on this fact. my infographic, as shown below, is a showing of all of the fast-food joints on fifth and forbes avenue.
        <p> the original dataset includes information from all over allegheny county, however, i decided to focus on the hub of the University of Pittsburgh, and catalogue the fifteen fast-food restaurants on fifth and forbes avenues.

      <p> this data is based on a dataset from the western pennsylvania regional data center (WPRDC). the organization takes data specific to the region and organizes it in the style of maps, tables, and other infographics. you can go to the original dataset for the project by clicking <a href="https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-fast-food">here</a> 
        <p> as you can see at the beginning of this post, my infographic is a very simplified version of the data given on the WPRDC website. as this is a beginning project, i do not have the skillset available to me to make advanced infographics such as the one on the WPRDC site. but, i believe that my infographic could also be useful to those who want their info fast. 
          <p> the map on the WPRDC website is quite advanced, and is interactive, meaning, to get access to all the data present, one must click on certain components of the site. 
            <p> in my infographic, all of the data is laid out in front of you in a simple bar chart. simple to read, simple to get all of the information.
              <p> therefore, there's not much to explain when it comes to my infographic. everything is pretty much laid out in front of you. 
                the four bars represent the four categories present in the original dataset. the x-axis shows these categories, and the y-axis shows the number of restaurants present in each of these categories.
